<h3><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>


<p>Richard Sherry’s <i>A Treatise of Schemes and Tropes</i> (1550),
a&nbsp;familiar work of the Renaissance, is primarily thought of as a
sixteenth-century English textbook on the figures. Yet it is also a
mirror of one variation of rhetoric which came to be called the rhetoric
of style. As a representative of this stylistic school, it offers little
that is new to the third part of classical rhetoric. Instead, it carries
forward the medieval concept that ornateness in communication is
desirable; it suggests that figures are tools for achieving this
ornateness; it supplies examples of ornateness to be imitated in writing
and speaking; it supports knowing the figures in order to understand
both secular and religious writings; it proposes that clarity is found
in the figures. In short, the work assisted Englishmen to understand
eloquence as well as to create&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Four-fifths of ancient rhetoric is omitted in the <i>Treatise</i>.
The nod is given to elocution. Invention is discussed, but only as a
tool to assist the communicator in amplifying his ideas, as a means to
spin out his thoughts to extreme lengths. Arrangement, memory, and
delivery are overlooked. Accordingly, the <i>Treatise</i> neatly fits
into the category of a Renaissance rhetoric on style. It is this school
which recognized the traditional five Ciceronian parts of rhetoric, but
considered style to be the most significant precept.
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
The <i>Treatise</i> is not the first to support an emphasis wholly on
style, nor the foremost. We know that Aristotle’s <i>Rhetoric</i>,
Cicero’s works on rhetoric, and Quintilian’s <i>Institutes</i> discussed
the significance of style, but they had a broad view. However, in
England, about the time of Bede, arose a limited concept that rhetoric
is mainly style, particularly that of the figures. It is this latter
truncated version of rhetoric that the <i>Treatise</i> continues in the
Renaissance. Rhetoric in Sherry’s work has lost its ancient meaning.</p>

<p>The <i>Treatise</i> is highly prescriptive. It was born in an age of
rules. So much so, that the rhetorician who named his rules and tools
was not out of rapport with the period. This accounts for the rigidity,
the love of classification, and the schematic presentation of the work.
It is nothing more than a highly organized dictionary of ancient,
medieval, and Renaissance schemes and tropes. In fact, the major
variation from previous Latin compilers is to be found in the headnotes
relative to the various kinds of figures. Nor is it as thorough in
handling the figures as its predecessors. It utilizes, however, the
customary Greek and Latin terms and supplies a definition, but here the
similarity with contemporaries and ancients ends. It is weak in
amplification of examples during an age when amplification was
practiced. Sherry economizes by selecting usually one example in support
of a figure while contemporary cataloguers, and ancients for that
matter, are more definitive.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<p>Whether the work was ever popular within the schools or without is
unclear. Probably it did not have extensive success because only one
issue of the work appeared and a revised edition was brought out in
1555. By contrast, during the sixteenth century, Erasmus’ <i>De
Copia</i> (1512) had at least eleven printings, Mosellanus’ <i>Table</i>
(c.&nbsp;1529) had at least eight editions, Susenbrotus’ <i>Epitome</i>
(1541) had at least twenty printings, Peacham’s <i>Garden</i> (1577) had
two editions, and Day’s <i>Secretorie</i> (1586) underwent at least five
editions. Some of these works had new editions printed in the
seventeenth century and would seem to reflect a greater public
acceptance than the <i>Treatise</i>. Some were also written in Latin
while Sherry moves in the vernacular. It still was an age of Latin, and
Sherry in part recognized this by his alternate Latin and English
movement in his second rhetoric on style published in 1555. Moreover,
people seemed content to remain with the giants of the Renaissance,
notably Erasmus and his <i>De Copia</i> instead of turning to a lesser
light such as Sherry.</p>

<p>The <i>Treatise</i> does have merit. The work cannot be judged
entirely by tallying its meager number of editions, its lack of
thoroughness, or its artificial divisions. Its signal contribution rests
upon the fact that it is a pioneering effort at permitting the figures
to march, for the first time, in English. Here Sherry had an opportunity
to provide the English reader with additional words, ideas, and material
to be employed in vernacular communication. His efforts in his works on
rhetoric, the two editions of the <i>Treatise</i>, provided
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
the sixteenth century Englishman with the identical schemes and tropes
which had been a heritage of the Latin language since antiquity. Hence
the work can be called a complicated ordering of the figures, but it is
also a sincere attempt to provide in English those figures which would
lend ornateness to the expression of an idea.</p>

<p>To indicate that the <i>Treatise</i> was part of a continuing school
of rhetoric, we must consider a few rhetoricians subsequent to Sherry’s
work. Indeed, one notices the continuance of dictionaries of figures
which carry the admonition that the usual manner of utterance was to be
despised. Thomas Wilson’s <i>The Arte of Rhetorique</i> (1553), although
preserving the classical idea of rhetoric, also felt the definition of a
figure employed in communication involved the uncommon. Twenty-seven
years subsequent to Sherry, England again has a pure catalogue of the
figures; this is Peacham’s <i>Garden of Eloquence</i>. More elaborate
than the <i>Treatise</i>, it too suggests that rhetoric is decoration.
Continued interest in the stylistic tools is also seen in Puttenham’s
The <i>Arte of English Poesie</i> (1589). When we move to the latter
part of the sixteenth century and then change the genre as exemplified
in Day’s <i>The English Secretorie</i>, we see a stylistic extension to
the art of letter writing which borrowed rhetorical terms and rules and
applied them to written correspondence. The emphasis in these rhetorics
on style is the same: ornateness in communication is achieved through
using the figures.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<p>When we look in the opposite direction, to works which preceded
Sherry, the figures, definitions, and examples in the <i>Treatise</i>
derive more from contemporaries than from the ancients. It relies
extensively upon intermediaries. Sherry explains that Erasmus and
Mosellanus will be major sources. Hence the <i>De Copia</i>, the
<i>Ecclesiastae</i>, and the <i>Tabulae de schematibus et tropis</i> are
used with regularity. Although further removed in time, the <i>Rhetorica
ad Herennium</i> is the primary ancient source. But beyond this
first-hand reliance on the ancients, examples from Vergil, Cicero, and
Terence, to mention several, as well as definitions of the figures,
depend heavily upon neo-classical intermediaries.</p>

<p>Appended to the text on the figures of rhetoric is a seemingly
gratuitous section entitled “That chyldren oughte to be taught and
brought vp gently in vertue and learnynge, and that euen forthwyth from
theyr natiuitie: a&nbsp;declamacion of a briefe theme, by Erasmus of
Roterodame.” This essay occupies almost two-thirds of the
<i>Treatise</i> and receives its first English translation from the
Latin at the hands of Sherry. William Woodward in his <i>Desiderius
Erasmus Concerning the Aim and Method of Education</i> gave us another
English translation in 1904. One other translation, in German, by August
Israel, is entitled “Vortrag über die Nothwendigkeit, die Knaben gleich
von der Geburt an in einer für Freigeborne würdigen Weise sittlich und
wissenschaftlich ausbilden zu lassen.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<p>The reason for the inclusion of the Erasmian essay is never clearly
stated in the other sections of the <i>Treatise</i>. Nor do the other
translators suppose a reason. From the internal evidence of the essay
and from headnotes preceding it, we may assume that the purpose is one
of supplying readers with an example of amplification of a brief theme,
first illustrated in miniature, and then full blown into a long
declamation. The essay does not appear to be illustrating the numerous
figures discussed in the initial section of the work.</p>

<p>Of Sherry we know little. Beyond the dates in the DNB, we infer from
his works that he had an intense interest in English and had a desire
for his countrymen to communicate well in the vernacular. He was
interested in religion, was most likely a Protestant, and hoped to
continue an interest in religion which he developed in his youth. He was
also a teacher. And although Latin was still a living language, the task
of inculcating a new tongue in the students fell to the schoolmaster;
Sherry was active in this capacity. This does not weaken an acclamation
we possess of the man: “He was a Person elegantly learned.”</p>

The common scholemasters be wont in readynge, to saye vnto their
scholers: <i>Hic est figura</i>: and sometyme to axe them, <i>Per quam

speakynge and wrytynge nothyng is more folyshe than to affecte or fondly

it the most profitable and hardeste: in the whyche is seene that diuine
myghte and vertue of an oratoure, whych as Cicero in hys oratorie
particions defineth, is nothyng else but wisedom speakyng eloquently.
For vnto the maruelous greate inuencion of all thynges, bothe it addeth
a fulnes, and varietie: it setteth oute &amp; garnysheth wyth lyghtes of
eloquent speche, the thinges that be spoken of and also wyth very graue

and indyghtyng. And oute of thys greate streame of eloquucion, not only
must we chose apte, and mete wordes, but also take hede of placinge, and

eloquucion consisteth in wordes considered by them selues, and when they

them selues, and <a name = "worde_compound" id =

composicion &amp; dignitie, which belongeth to the other.</p>

care, to speake euidentlye after the dignitye and nature of thynges, and
to vtter suche wordes, whych as Cicero sayth in hys oratour, no man may
iustely reprehende. The playne and euident speche is learned of
Gramarians, and it keepeth the oracion pure, and without all faute, and
maketh that euerye

speche standeth by vsuall wordes that be in vse of daylye talke, and
proper wordes that belonge to the thinge, of the which we shal speke.
<!-- newline --> Neyther be properties to be referred onely to the name

that Poetes do speake in a maner as it were in another tonge, it is
righte sone perceiued. Finally two fautes are cõmitted in euerye

<p>Before we come to the precepts of garnishing an oraciõ, we thinke
good, bryeflye, to shewe you of the thre kyndes of stile or endyghting,
in the whych all the eloquucion of an oratoure is occupied. For that
there be thre sundry kyndes, called of the Grekes characters, of vs
figures, I&nbsp;trowe there is no man, though he be meanlye learned, but
he knoweth, namely when we se so manye wryters of sciences, bothe Greke
and latine, whych haue ben before tyme, to haue folowed for the mooste
parte sundrye sortes of wrytyng, the one vnlyke to the other. And there

The greate kynde.</a></h5>

<p>The greate, the noble, the mightye, and the full kynde of
endyghtynge, wyth an incredible, &amp; a certen diuine power of oracion,
is vsed in wayghty causes: for it hathe wyth an ample maiestye verye
garnyshed wordes, proper, translated, &amp; graue sentences, whych ar
handled in amplificacion, and commiseracion, and it hathe exornations
bothe of woordes and sentences, wherunto in oracions they ascribe verye
great strength and grauitie. <!-- newline --> And they that vse thys
kynde, bee vehement, various, copious, graue, appoynted and readye
thorowlye to moue and turne mens myndes. <!-- newline --> Thys kynd dyd
Cicero vse in the oracion for Aulus Cluencius, for Sylla, for Titus
Annius Milo, for Caius Rabirius: agaynste Catiline, agaynste Verres,
agaynste Piso. But they that can not skyll of it oftentimes fall into
fautes, when vnto them that seemeth a graue oracion, whych swelleth, and

<p>The small kynde of indighting, is in a subtile, pressed, and fyled
oracion, meete for causes that be a lytel sharper then are in the comon
vse of speakynge. For it is a kynde of oracion that is lette downe euen
to the mooste vsed custume of pure and clere speakyng. It hathe fyne
sentences, subtile, sharpe, teachyng all thynges, and makynge them more
playne, not more ample. ¶&nbsp;And in the same kynde (as Cicero sayeth
in hys oratoure) some bee craftye, but vnpolyshed, and of purpose lyke
the rude and vnskylfull: <!-- newline --> Other in that leaues are
trymme, that is somwhat floryshynge also and garnyshed. Cicero vsed thys
kynde in hys philosophicall disputacions, in the oraciõ for Quincius for

<p>The mean and temperate kynd of indyghting standeth of the lower, and
yet not of the loweste, and moste comen wordes and sentẽces. <!--
newline --> And it is ryghtyly called the temperate kynde of speakyng,
because it is very nygh vnto the small, and to the greate kynde,
folowyng a moderacion and temper betwyxt thẽ. <!-- newline --> And it
foloweth as we saye in one tenour, distinguyshyng all the oracion wyth
small ornamentes both of wordes, and sentences. Cicero vseth thys for
the lawe of Manilius, for Aulus Cecinna, for Marcus Marcellus, and moste
of all in hys bookes of offices. In this it is fautye to come to the
kynd that is nye vnto it, whyche is called dissolute, because it waueth
hyther and thyther, as it were wythout senowes and ioyntes, standyng
surely in no poynte. And suche an oracion can not cause the hearer to

A greate parte of eloquence is set in increasing and diminyshing, and

in dede, lesser or greater then it seemeth to manye. For the rude people
haue commonly a preposterous iudgemẽt, and take the worst thynges for
the beste, and the beste for the worst. Al amplificacion and diminucion
is taken eyther of thinges, or of wordes. Of thynges ryse effeccions, of
words those fashions that nowe I wyll shewe. The first waye of
increasyng or diminishing is by chaungynge the worde of the thynge, when
in encreasynge we vse a more cruell worde, and a softer in diminyshynge,

increase is, when wythoute distinccion in the context and course of the

bygger then the fyrste, and that we come to the hyest by a swyfte pace.
As he was not ashamed to playe at dyce wyth iesters in the common

that much matter may be taken of thynges belongyng to a personne, so
maye be also of those that belonge to a thynge or cause, whiche places
bee so handeled of Quintiliane, that he myngleth thẽ wyth the places
whyche Aristotle hathe comprehended in hys eyghte

Circumstances of the thynges be these: Cause, place, tyme, chaunce,
facultie, instrumente, manour. And fyrste of euerye thinge there be
foure causes, efficient, materiall, formall and finall. Matter is the
receptacle of al formes. The forme causeth it to be thys, and not
another thynge: as the reasonable soule geueth to the body that it is a
man, and the soule because it is a substaunce hathe her vnnamed forme,
whereby she is a soule, and not an aungel.
<span class = "sidenote">
Fine or ende.</span>
And what soeuer is made, is made to a certen ende, and one thynge maye
haue diuerse endes: as nature hathe geuen brestes vnto women to geue
milke, and also for comlynesse of theyr bodies, neyther doth any man
that is of a sounde mynde take vpon hym anye businesse, but for that he
desyreth to haue some thynge: nor there is nothynge desyred, but vnder
the consideracion of good or profite. ¶&nbsp;So the ende whyche is laste
in effecte, and fyrste in intencion, loketh vpon the gettinge of
profites, increase, and cõfirmacion of them,
<span class = "pagenum reprint">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
and also vpon them, eschuynge of disprofites, diminyshynge, or puttyng
them awaye. But in chosyng them, false perswacion deceyueth manye,
whylest by errour they beleue that to be good y<sup>t</sup> is naughte.
¶&nbsp;This place therfore serueth for many thynges, to make more or
lesse. ¶&nbsp;Greatly happy shulde men be, if euerye man wolde looke
vpon the marke, not the whych desyre hathe sette before hym, but whyche
God and honest reason hath prefixed. ¶&nbsp;And of such strengthe is the
ende, that hereof is taken the felicitie of euery thyng. To fast that
the body maye obeye the mynde, to do good workes is an holy deede. To
fast to be counted holye, is hypocrisie. To faste to encrease thy good,
is couetousenesse. To faste to be whole in thy bodie is phisycke, and so
of praiynge, almose, and other laudable workes. After lyke maner must be
wayed the secondarie endes.
<span class = "sidenote">
Place.</span>
An other circumstaunce of a thynge, is the place, whose qualitie
oftentimes maketh the faute either greter or lesser: as to steale an

And in the seuenth of Ihon, when Christ sayth: My tyme is not yet come,

<span class = "sidenote">

The Rethoricianes put chaunce vnder tyme, because the ende of a thynge
perteyneth to the time that foloweth: but of thys wyll we speke in the
place called Euent. Facultie is a power to do the thynge that is taken
in hand: and in coniectures two thinges speciallye be considered:
whether he could or wold. Wyll is gathered of hope to performe it, and
is made more probable whẽ the nature of the mynde is ioyned to it: as it
is not like he wyl abide in his

the manour of doyng, that almoste it is all one. But more properlye

<h4><a name = "endnote" id = "endnote">Notes on the Text</a></h4>

<h5>Paragraphs</h5>

<p>Some paragraph breaks in this e-text are conjectural. The printed
book had the following kinds of breaks:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p>conventional paragraph with indented first line</p>
<p>unambiguous paragraph with non-indented first line</p>
<p>ambiguous paragraph: previous line ends with blank space, but the
space is not large enough to contain the first syllable of the
following line</p>
<p>sentence break corresponds to line break: this happens randomly in
any printed book, and only becomes ambiguous when the book also has
non-indented paragraphs</p>
</div>

<p>In this e-text, the second type of paragraph is marked with a simple
line break (no extra space) and pilcrow&nbsp;¶. The third type has a
pilcrow ¶ but no line break. The fourth type is not marked.</p>

<h5>Transcriber’s Footnote</h5>

<p><a name = "endnote1" id = "endnote1" href = "#endtag1">*</a>
<b>homotelento, -teleto</b>: <br>
In the facsimile edition, the body text has <i>homoteleto</i> but
the Index has <i>homotelento</i>. In the other available text, the body
text has <i>homotelẽto</i> with clear overline. The correct form is
“homeoteleuton” (in this book’s spelling, probably “homioteleuton”).</p>

<h5>Spelling</h5>

<p>The pattern of initial <b>v</b>, non-initial <b>u</b> is followed
consistently.</p>
<p>The spelling “they” is more common than “thei”.</p>
<p>The form “then” is normally used for both “then” and “than”; “than”
is rare.</p>
<p>The most common spelling is “wyll”, but “wyl”, “wil” and “will” also
occur.</p>

<h5>Word Division</h5>

<p>Line-end hyphens were completely arbitrary; words split at line break
were hyphenated about two-thirds of the time. The presence or absence of
a hyphen has not been noted. Hyphenless words at line-end were joined or
separated depending on behavior elsewhere in the text:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p><i>Always one word</i> (re-joined at line break): som(e)what,
without, afterward(e)s</p>
<p><i>Usually one word:</i> often( )times, what( )so( )euer</p>
<p><i>One or two words:</i> an( )other</p>
<p><i>Usually two words:</i> it/him/my...( )self/selues; shal(&nbsp;)be;
straight(&nbsp;)way</p>
<p><i>Always two words:</i> here to</p>
</div>

<h5>Roman Numerals</h5>

<p>Numbers were printed with leading and following .period. When the
number came at the beginning or end of a line, the “outer” period was
sometimes omitted. These have been supplied for consistency.</p>
</div>
